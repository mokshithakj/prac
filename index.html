<div class="content"> <small><article>Everyone has to work at each and every stage of their life cycle. As much as the work done by the elders is claimed to be important, students nowadays also have to work. They have a huge syllabus to complete and study for the upcoming exams. The pressure on students to perform well academically never fades, and thus, students spend more time engulfed in their books rather than enjoying their childhood.</article><br>

    <article>The importance of studies is very much nowadays, and a good student knows exactly how much it is important for growth and development but having a proper balance between personal and work-related things is what every student should aim at. Students should know that time waits for none, and if they do not try to live their childhood at this point, they won't get this time again to relive the same. A student's personal development is very much important for their proper growth.</article></small>
